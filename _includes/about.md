My name is Nick Craver. I am the Architecture Lead for [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/). My day to day job keeps me fairly busy, keeping [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and the rest of our network running. My days consist of being a software developer, sysadmin, DBA, architect, network fixer, hardware installer, data center whatever, all around debugger, and many things in-between. I love what I do and who I do it with. I'm privileged to work and learn from and along with some of the smartest people in my field. My blog exists to share that knowledge.

It's not a company PR line that Stack Exchange is here to promote learning and spread knowledge - it's very fundamental to everything we do and a calling to many who work there, including me. I believe that sharing what we build, how we build it, and the mistakes we made along the way improves the experience and saves time for the next 100 or 100,000 people doing similar. For the same reasons, I believe strongly in open source. I maintain a few open source projects: [Opserver](https://github.com/Opserver/Opserver), [StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional), [MiniProfiler](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet), [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis), [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/), and [this blog](https://github.com/NickCraver/nickcraver.github.com) as well.

In the mean time, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13249/nick-craver), [GitHub](https://github.com/NickCraver), and occasionally <a href="https://plus.google.com/109466935056652719352/posts" rel="me">Google+</a>.
